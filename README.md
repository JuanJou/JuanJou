#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Juan Jouglard and i am a student of IT Engineering at Universidad Nacional del Sur. The technologies that i enjoy the most working on are Front End stuff, like Javascript, Angular, React Native, etc. As you can see in my repos there are some projects developed with this technologies, but also there are other projects that were build using all sort of tools. Although i think that people should focus on one type of technology and learn that to the bone, i also think it's important to be aware of different approaches that exist in the IT world and to keep an open mind when solving problems using technology as a tool.
